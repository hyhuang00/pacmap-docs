Welcome to PaCMAP's documentation!
===================================

**PaCMAP** is a Python library for dimensionality reduction that can be used
for robust data visualiztion.
PaCMAP optimizes the low dimensional embedding using three kinds of pairs of 
points: neighbor pairs (`pair_neighbors`), mid-near pair (`pair_MN`), and 
further pairs (`pair_FP`).


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
